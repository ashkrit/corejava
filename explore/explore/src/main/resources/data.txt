anarchism
originated
as
a
term
of
abuse
first
used
against
early
working
class
radicals
including
the
diggers
of
the
english
revolution
and
the
sans
culottes
of
the
french
revolution
whilst
the
term
is
still
used
in
a
pejorative
way
to
describe
any
act
that
used
violent
means
to
destroy
the
organization
of
society
it
has
also
been
taken
up
as
a
positive
label
by
self
defined
anarchists
the
word
anarchism
is
derived
from
the
greek
without
archons
ruler
chief
king
anarchism
as
a
political
philosophy
is
the
belief
that
rulers
are
unnecessary
and
should
be
abolished
although
there
are
differing
interpretations
of
what
this
means
anarchism
also
refers
to
related
social
movements
that
advocate
the
elimination
of
authoritarian
institutions
particularly
the
state
the
word
anarchy
as
most
anarchists
use
it
does
not
imply
chaos
nihilism
or
anomie
but
rather
a
harmonious
anti
authoritarian
society
in
place
of
what
are
regarded
as
authoritarian
political
structures
and
coercive
economic
institutions
anarchists
advocate
social
relations
based
upon
voluntary
association
of
autonomous
individuals
mutual
aid
and
self
governance
while
anarchism
is
most
easily
defined
by
what
it
is
against
anarchists
also
offer
positive
visions
of
what
they
believe
to
be
a
truly
free
society
however
ideas
about
how
an
anarchist
society
might
work
vary
considerably
especially
with
respect
to
economics
there
is
also
disagreement
about
how
a
free
society
might
be
brought
about
origins
and
predecessors
kropotkin
and
others
argue
that
before
recorded
history
human
society
was
organized
on
anarchist
principles
most
anthropologists
follow
kropotkin
and
engels
in
believing
that
hunter
gatherer
bands
were
egalitarian
and
lacked
division
of
labour
accumulated
wealth
or
decreed
law
and
had
equal
access
to
resources
william
godwin
anarchists
including
the
the
anarchy
organisation
and
rothbard
find
anarchist
attitudes
in
taoism
from
ancient
china
kropotkin
found
similar
ideas
in
stoic
zeno
of
citium
according
to
kropotkin
zeno
repudiated
the
omnipotence
of
the
state
its
intervention
and
regimentation
and
proclaimed
the
sovereignty
of
the
moral
law
of
the
individual
the
anabaptists
of
one
six
th
century
europe
are
sometimes
considered
to
be
religious
forerunners
of
modern
anarchism
bertrand
russell
in
his
history
of
western
philosophy
writes
that
the
anabaptists
repudiated
all
law
since
they
held
that
the
good
man
will
be
guided
at
every
moment
by
the
holy
spirit
from
this
premise
they
arrive
at
communism
the
diggers
or
true
levellers
were
an
early
communistic
movement
during
the
time
of
the
english
civil
war
and
are
considered
by
some
as
forerunners
of
modern
anarchism
in
the
modern
era
the
first
to
use
the
term
to
mean
something
other
than
chaos
was
louis
armand
baron
de
lahontan
in
his
nouveaux
voyages
dans
l
am
rique
septentrionale
one
seven
zero
three
where
he
described
the
indigenous
american
society
which
had
no
state
laws
prisons
priests
or
private
property
as
being
in
anarchy
russell
means
a
libertarian
and
leader
in
the
american
indian
movement
has
repeatedly
stated
that
he
is
an
anarchist
and
so
are
all
his
ancestors
in
one
seven
nine
three
in
the
thick
of
the
french
revolution
william
godwin
published
an
enquiry
concerning
political
justice
although
godwin
did
not
use
the
word
anarchism
many
later
anarchists
have
regarded
this
book
as
the
first
major
anarchist
text
and
godwin
as
the
founder
of
philosophical
anarchism
but
at
this
point
no
anarchist
movement
yet
existed
and
the
term
anarchiste
was
known
mainly
as
an
insult
hurled
by
the
bourgeois
girondins
at
more
radical
elements
in
the
french
revolution
the
first
self
labelled
anarchist
pierre
joseph
proudhon
it
is
commonly
held
that
it
wasn
t
until
pierre
joseph
proudhon
published
what
is
property
in
one
eight
four
zero
that
the
term
anarchist
was
adopted
as
a
self
description
it
is
for
this
reason
that
some
claim
proudhon
as
the
founder
of
modern
anarchist
theory
in
what
is
property
proudhon
answers
with
the
famous
accusation
property
is
theft
in
this
work
he
opposed
the
institution
of
decreed
property
propri
t
where
owners
have
complete
rights
to
use
and
abuse
their
property
as
they
wish
such
as
exploiting
workers
for
profit
in
its
place
proudhon
supported
what
he
called
possession
individuals
can
have
limited
rights
to
use
resources
capital
and
goods
in
accordance
with
principles
of
equality
and
justice
proudhon
s
vision
of
anarchy
which
he
called
mutualism
mutuellisme
involved
an
exchange
economy
where
individuals
and
groups
could
trade
the
products
of
their
labor
using
labor
notes
which
represented
the
amount
of
working
time
involved
in
production
this
would
ensure
that
no
one
would
profit
from
the
labor
of
others
workers
could
freely
join
together
in
co
operative
workshops
an
interest
free
bank
would
be
set
up
to
provide
everyone
with
access
to
the
means
of
production
proudhon
s
ideas
were
influential
within
french
working
class
movements
and
his
followers
were
active
in
the
revolution
of
one
eight
four
eight
in
france
proudhon
s
philosophy
of
property
is
complex
it
was
developed
in
a
number
of
works
over
his
lifetime
and
there
are
differing
interpretations
of
some
of
his
ideas
for
more
detailed
discussion
see
here
max
stirner
s
egoism
in
his
the
ego
and
its
own
stirner
argued
that
most
commonly
accepted
social
institutions
including
the
notion
of
state
property
as
a
right
natural
rights
in
general
and
the
very
notion
of
society
were
mere
illusions
or
ghosts
in
the
mind
saying
of
society
that
the
individuals
are
its
reality
he
advocated
egoism
and
a
form
of
amoralism
in
which
individuals
would
unite
in
associations
of
egoists
only
when
it
was
in
their
self
interest
to
do
so
for
him
property
simply
comes
about
through
might
whoever
knows
how
to
take
to
defend
the
thing
to
him
belongs
property
and
what
i
have
in
my
power
that
is
my
own
so
long
as
i
assert
myself
as
holder
i
am
the
proprietor
of
the
thing
stirner
never
called
himself
an
anarchist
he
accepted
only
the
label
egoist
nevertheless
his
ideas
were
influential
on
many
individualistically
inclined
anarchists

interpretations
of
his
thought
are

own
the
product

as
private
property
and
believed
in

this

he
argued
that
in
a

system
without

would
eliminate

ensure
that

due

its
genuine

the

became
signficiant
from

start
karl
marx
was
a
leading
figure
in
the
international
he
was
elected
to
every
succeeding
general
council
of
the
association
the
first
objections
to
marx
came
from
the
mutualists
who
opposed
communism
and
statism
shortly
after
mikhail
bakunin
and
his
followers
joined
in
one

the

international
became
polarised
into
two
camps
with
marx
and
bakunin
as
their
respective
figureheads
the
clearest
difference
between
the
camps
was
over
strategy
the
anarchists
around
bakunin
favoured
in
kropotkin
s
words
direct
economical
struggle
against
capitalism
without
interfering
in
the
political
parliamentary
agitation
at
that
time
marx
and
his
followers
focused
on
parliamentary
activity
bakunin
characterised
marx
s
ideas
as
authoritarian
and
predicted
that
if
a
marxist
party
gained
to
power
its
leaders
would
end
up
as
bad
as
the
ruling
class
they
had
fought
against
in
one
eight
seven
two
the
conflict
climaxed
with
a
final
split
between
the
two
groups
at
the
hague
congress
this
is
often
cited
as
the
origin
of
the
conflict
between
anarchists
and
marxists
from
this
moment
the
social
democratic
and
libertarian
currents
of
socialism
had
distinct
organisations
including
rival
internationals
anarchist
communism
peter
kropotkin
proudhon
and
bakunin
both
opposed
communism
associating
it
with
statism
however
in
the
one
eight
seven
zero
s
many
anarchists
moved
away
from
bakunin
s
economic
thinking
called
collectivism
and
embraced
communist
concepts
communists
believed
the
means
of
production
should
be
owned
collectively
and
that
goods
be
distributed
by
need
not
labor
an
early
anarchist
communist
was
joseph
d
jacque
the
first
person
to
describe
himself
as
libertarian
unlike
proudhon
he
argued
that
it
is
not
the
product
of
his
or
her
labor
that
the
worker
has
a
right
to
but
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
or
her
needs
whatever
may
be
their
nature

disliked

several
individualist
anarchists
maintained
that
abolition
of

property
was
not
consistent
with
liberty
for
example

professing
respect

work
described
communist
anarchism
as
pseudo
anarchism
propaganda
of
the
deed
johann
most
was
an
outspoken
advocate
of
violence
anarchists
have
often
been
portrayed
as
dangerous
and
violent
due
mainly
to
a
number
of
high
profile
violent
acts
including
riots
assassinations
insurrections
and
terrorism
by
some
anarchists
some
revolutionaries
of
the
late
one

century
encouraged
acts
of
political
violence
such
as
bombings
and
the
assassinations
of
heads
of
state
to
further
anarchism
such
actions
have
sometimes
been
called
propaganda
by
the
deed
one
of
the
more
outspoken
advocates
of
this
strategy
was
johann
most
who
said
the
existing
system
will
be
quickest
and
most
radically
overthrown
by
the
annihilation
of
its
exponents
therefore
massacres
of
the
enemies
of
the
people
must
be
set
in

preferred
method

earned
him

moniker

however
there
is
no
consensus
on
the
legitimacy
or
utility
of
violence
in
general
mikhail
bakunin
and
errico
malatesta
for
example
wrote
of
violence
as
a
necessary
and
sometimes
desirable
force
in
revolutionary
settings
but
at
the

time
they
denounced
acts
of
individual
terrorism

violence

bakunin

he
refuted

identified

anarcha
feminism

of
radical

the

is
a
fundamental
problem
in

while
anarchist
feminism
has
existed
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
its
explicit
formulation
as
anarcha
feminism
dates
back
to
the
early
seven
zero
s
during
the
second
wave
feminist
movement
anarcha
feminism
views
patriarchy
as
the
first
manifestation
of
hierarchy
in
human
history
thus
the
first
form
of
oppression
occurred
in
the
dominance
of
male
over
female
anarcha
feminists
then
conclude
that
if
feminists
are
against
patriarchy
they
must
also
be
against
all
forms
of
hierarchy
and
therefore
must
reject
the
authoritarian
nature
of
the
state
and
capitalism
anarcho
primitivists
see
the
creation
of
gender
roles
and
patriarchy
a
creation
of
the
start
of
civilization
and
therefore
consider
primitivism
to
also
be

addresses

with
the

it

anarchists
argue
that
pursuit
of

many
argue
that
the

is
incompatible
with

and

anarchists
argue
that
the

national
anarchism
is
a
political
view
which
seeks
to
unite
cultural
or
ethnic
preservation
with
anarchist
views
its
adherents
propose
that
those
preventing
ethnic
groups
or
races
from
living
in
separate
autonomous
groupings
should
be
resisted
anti
racist
action
is
not
an
anarchist
group
but
many
anarchists
are
involved
it
focuses
on
publicly
confronting

the

movement
of
chiapas
mexico
is
a
cultural

group
with
some
anarchist
proclivities
neocolonialism
and

nearly
all
anarchists
oppose
neocolonialism
as
an
attempt
to
use
economic
coercion
on
a
global
scale
carried
out
through
state
institutions
such
as
the
world
bank
world
trade
organization
group
of
eight
and
the
world
economic
forum
globalization
is
an
ambiguous
term
that
has
different
meanings
to
different
anarchist
factions
most
anarchists
use
the
term
to
mean
neocolonialism
and
or
cultural
imperialism
which
they
may
see
as
related
many
are
active
in
the
anti
globalization
movement
others
particularly
anarcho
capitalists
use
globalization
to
mean
the
worldwide
expansion
of
the
division
of
labor
and
trade
which
they
see
as
beneficial
so
long
as
governments
do
not
intervene
parallel
structures
many
anarchists
try
to
set
up
alternatives
to
state
supported
institutions
and
outposts
such
as
food
not
bombs
infoshops
educational
systems
such
as
home
schooling
neighborhood
mediation
arbitration
groups
and
so
on

idea
is
to
create
the
structures
for
a
new
anti

in

recent
technological
developments
have
made
the
anarchist
cause
both
easier
to
advance
and

these

some
anarchists
see
information
technology
as
the
best
weapon
to
defeat

some

makes

consider

follow
leo

anarchists
see
war
as
an
activity
in
which
the

seeks
to
gain
and
consolidate
power
both
domestically
and
in
foreign
lands

parliamentarianism
in

terms
the

ethos
opposes

most
anarchist
schools
of

are

sectarian
there
is

difference
of
opinion
within
each
school
about
how
to
react
to
or

with
other
schools
some
such
as
panarchists
believe
that
it
is
possible
for
a
variety
of
modes
of
social
life
to
coexist

some
anarchists
view
opposing

as

criticisms
of
anarchism
violence
since
anarchism
has
often
been
associated
with
violence
and
destruction
some
people
have
seen
it
as
being
too
violent
on
the
other
hand
hand
frederick
engels
criticsed
anarchists
for
not
being
violent
enough
a
revolution
is
certainly
the
most
authoritarian
thing
there
is
it
is
the
act
whereby
one
part
of
the
population
imposes
its
will
upon
the
other
part
by
means
of
rifles
bayonets
and
cannon
authoritarian
means
if
such
there
be
at
all
and
if
the
victorious
party
does
not
want
to
have
fought
in
vain
it
must
maintain
this
rule
by
means
of
the
terror
which
its
arms
inspire
in
the
reactionists
would
the
paris
commune
have
lasted
a
single
day
if
it
had
not
made
use
of
this
authority
of
the
armed
people
against
the
bourgeois
utopianism
anarchism
is
often
criticised
as
unfeasible
or
plain
utopian
even
by
many
who
agree
that
it
s
a
nice
idea
in
principle
for
example
carl
landauer
in
his
book
european
socialism
criticizes
anarchism
as
being
unrealistically
utopian
and
holds
that
government
is
a
lesser
evil
than
a
society
without
repressive
force
he
holds
that
the
belief
that
ill
intentions
will
cease
if
repressive
force
disappears
is
an
absurdity
however
it
must
be
noted
that
not
all
anarchists
have
such
a
utopian
view
of
anarchism
for
example
some
such
as
benjamin
tucker
advocate
privately
funded
institutions
that
defend
individual
liberty
and
property
however
other
anarchists
such
as
sir
herbert
read
proudly
accept
the
characterization
utopian
class
character
marxists
have
characterised
anarchism
as
an
expression
of
the
class
interests
of
the
petite
bourgeoisie
or
perhaps
the
lumpenproletariat

tacit
authoritarianism
in
recent
decades
anarchism
has
been
criticised
by
situationists
post
anarchists
and
others
of
preserving
tacitly
statist
authoritarian
or
bureaucratic
tendencies
behind
a
dogmatic
facade
hypocrisy
some
critics
point
to
the
sexist
and
racist
views
of
some
prominent
anarchists
notably
proudhon
and
bakunin
as
examples
of
hypocrisy
inherent
within
anarchism
while
many
anarchists
however
dismiss
that
the
personal
prejudices
of
one
nine
th
century
theorists
influence
the
beliefs
of
present

anarchists
others
criticise
modern
anarchism
for
continuing
to

impact
of
anarchist
thinkers
like

caplan
argues
that
the
treatment
of
fascists
and
suspected
fascist
sympathizers
by
spanish
anarchists
in
the
spanish
civil
war
was
a
form
of
illegitimate
coercion
making

just
a

although
the
specific

of
autism
is

many

suspect
that
autism
results
from
genetically
mediated
vulnerabilities
to
environmental
triggers
and
while
there
is
disagreement
about
the
magnitude
nature
and
mechanisms
for
such
environmental
factors
researchers
have
found
at

seven
major
genes
prevalent
among
individuals
diagnosed

a

some
now
speculate
that
autism
is
not
a
single
condition
but
a
group
of
several
distinct
conditions
that
manifest
in
similar
ways
by
definition
autism
must
manifest

in
social

language
as
used
in
social

or

the

also
says
that
symptoms
must
manifest
before
the
age
of

years
there
have
been
large
increases
in
the
reported
incidence
of
autism
for
reasons
that
are
heavily
debated
by
researchers
in
psychology
and
related
fields
within
the
scientific
community
some
children
with
autism
have
improved
their
social
and
other
skills
to
the
point
where
they
can
fully
participate
in
mainstream
education
and
social
events
but
there
are
lingering
concerns
that
an
absolute
cure
from
autism
is
impossible
with
current
technology
however
many
autistic
children
and
adults
who
are
able
to
communicate
at
least
in
writing
are
opposed
to
attempts
to
cure
their
conditions
and
see
such
conditions
as
part
of
who
they
are
history
dr
hans
asperger
described
a
form
of
autism
in
the
one
nine
four
zero
s
that
later
became
known
as
asperger
s
syndrome
the
word
autism
was
first
used
in
the
english
language
by
swiss
psychiatrist
eugene
bleuler
in
a
one
nine
one
two
number
of
the
american
journal
of
insanity
it
comes
from
the
greek
word
for
self
however
the
classification
of
autism
did
not
occur
until
the
middle
of
the
twentieth
century
when
in
one
nine
four
three
psychiatrist
dr
leo
kanner
of
the
johns
hopkins
hospital
in
baltimore
reported
on
one
one
child
patients
with
striking
behavioral
similarities
and
introduced
the
label
early
infantile
autism
he
suggested
autism
from
the
greek
autos
meaning
self
to
describe
the
fact
that
the
children
seemed
to
lack
interest
in
other
people
although
kanner
s
first
paper
on
the
subject
was
published
in
a
now
defunct
journal
the
nervous
child
almost
every
characteristic
he
originally
described
is
still
regarded
as
typical
of
the
autistic
spectrum
of
disorders
at
the
same
time
an
austrian
scientist
dr
hans
asperger
described
a
different
form
of
autism
that
became
known
as
asperger
s
syndrome
but
the
widespread
recognition
of
asperger
s
work
was
delayed
by
world
war
ii
in
germany
and
by
the
fact
that
his
seminal
paper
wasn
t
translated
into
english
for
almost
five
zero
years
the
majority
of
his
work
wasn
t
widely
read
until
one

few

which
are
based

dr
leo
kanner
introduced
the
label
early
infantile
autism
in
one
nine

three
there
is
a
great
diversity
in
the
skills
and
behaviors
of
individuals
diagnosed
as
autistic
and
physicians
will
often
arrive
at
different
conclusions
about
the
appropriate
diagnosis
much
of
this
is
due
to
the
sensory
system
of
an
autistic
which
is
quite
different
from
the
sensory
system
of
other
people
since
certain
stimulations
can
affect
an
autistic
differently
than
a
non
autistic
and
the
degree
to
which
the
sensory
system
is
affected
varies
wildly
from
one
autistic
person
to
another
nevertheless
professionals
within
pediatric
care
and
development
often
look
for
early
indicators
of
autism
in
order
to
initiate
treatment
as
early
as
possible
however
some
people
do
not
believe
in
treatment
for
autism
either
because
they
do
not
believe
autism
is
a
disorder
or
because
they
believe
treatment
can
do
more
harm
than
good
social
development
typically
developing
infants
are
social
beings
early
in
life
they
do
such
things
as
gaze
at
people
turn
toward
voices
grasp
a
finger
and
even
smile
in
contrast
most
autistic
children
prefer
objects
to
faces
and
seem
to
have
tremendous
difficulty
learning
to
engage
in
the
give
and
take
of
everyday
human
interaction
even
in
the
first
few
months
of
life
many
seem
indifferent
to
other
people
because
they
avoid
eye
contact
and
do
not
interact
with
them
as
often
as
non
autistic
children
children
with
autism
often
appear
to
prefer
being
alone
to
the
company
of
others
and
may
passively
accept
such
things
as
hugs
and
cuddling
without
reciprocating
or
resist
attention
altogether
later
they
seldom
seek
comfort
from
others
or
respond
to
parents
displays
of
anger
or
affection
in
a
typical
way
research
has
suggested
that
although
autistic
children
are
attached
to
their
parents
their
expression
of
this
attachment
is
unusual
and
difficult
to
interpret
parents
who
looked
forward
to
the
joys
of
cuddling
teaching
and
playing
with
their
child
may
feel
crushed
by
this
lack
of
expected
attachment
behavior
children
with
autism
appear
to
lack
theory
of
mind
the
ability
to
see
things
from
another
person
s
perspective
a
behavior
cited
as
exclusive
to
human
beings
above
the
age
of
five
and
possibly
other
higher
primates
such
as
adult
gorillas
chimpanzees
and
bonobos
typical
five
year
olds
can
develop
insights
into
other
people
s
different
knowledge
feelings
and
intentions
interpretations
based
upon
social
cues
e
g
gestures
facial
expressions
an
individual
with
autism
seems
to
lack
these
interpretation
skills
an
inability
that
leaves
them
unable
to
predict
or
understand
other
people
s
actions
the
social
alienation
of
autistic
and
asperger
s
people
is
so
intense
from
childhood
that
many
of
them
have
imaginary
friends
as
companionship
however
having
an
imaginary
friend
is
not
necessarily
a
sign
of
autism
and
also
occurs
in
non
autistic
children
although
not
universal
it
is
common
for
autistic
people
to
not
regulate
their
behavior
this
can
take
the
form
of
crying
or
verbal
outbursts
that
may
seem
out
of
proportion
to
the
situation
individuals
with
autism
generally
prefer
consistent
routines
and
environments
they
may
react
negatively
to
changes
in
them
it
is
not
uncommon
for
these
individuals
to
exhibit
aggression
increased
levels
of
self
stimulatory
behavior
self
injury
or
extensive
withdrawal
in
overwhelming
situations
sensory
system
a
key
indicator
to
clinicians
making
a
proper
assessment
for
autism
would
include
looking
for
symptoms
much
like
those
found
in
sensory
integration
dysfunction
children
will
exhibit
problems
coping
with
the
normal
sensory
input
indicators
of
this
disorder
include
oversensitivity
or
underreactivity
to
touch
movement
sights
or
sounds
physical
clumsiness
or
carelessness
poor
body
awareness
a
tendency
to
be
easily
distracted
impulsive
physical
or
verbal
behavior
an
activity
level
that
is
unusually
high
or
low
not
unwinding
or
calming
oneself
difficulty
learning
new
movements
difficulty
in
making
transitions
from
one
situation
to
another
social
and
or
emotional
problems
delays
in
speech
language
or
motor
skills
specific
learning
difficulties
delays
in
academic
achievement
one
common
example
is
an
individual
with
autism
hearing
a
person
with
autism
may
have
trouble
hearing
certain
people
while
other
people
are
louder
than
usual
or
the
person
with
autism
may
be
unable
to
filter
out
sounds
in
certain
situations
such
as
in
a
large
crowd
of
people
see
cocktail
party
effect
however
this
is
perhaps
the
part
of
the
autism
that
tends
to
vary
the
most
from
person
to
person
so
these
examples
may
not
apply
to
every
autistic
it
should
be
noted
that
sensory
difficulties
although
reportedly
common
in
autistics
are
not
part
of
the
dsm
iv
diagnostic
criteria
for
autistic
disorder
communication
difficulties
by
age
three
typical
children
have
passed
predictable
language
learning
milestones
one
of
the
earliest
is
babbling
by
the
first
birthday
a
typical
toddler
says
words
turns
when
he
or
she
hears
his
or
her
name
points
when
he
or
she
wants
a
toy
and
when
offered
something
distasteful
makes
it
clear
that
the
answer
is
no
speech
development
in
people
with
autism
takes
different
paths
some
remain
mute
throughout
their
lives
while
being
fully
literate
and
able
to
communicate
in
other
ways
images
sign
language
and
typing
are
far
more
natural
to
them
some
infants
who
later
show
signs
of
autism
coo
and
babble
during
the
first
few
months
of
life
but
stop
soon
afterwards
others
may
be
delayed
developing
language
as
late
as
the
teenage
years
still
inability
to
speak
does
not
mean
that
people
with
autism
are
unintelligent
or
unaware
once
given
appropriate
accommodations
many
will
happily
converse
for
hours
and
can
often
be
found
in
online
chat
rooms
discussion
boards
or
websites
and
even
using
communication
devices
at
autism
community
social
events
such
as
autreat
those
who
do
speak
often
use
language
in
unusual
ways
retaining
features
of
earlier
stages
of
language
development
for
long
periods
or
throughout
their
lives
some
speak
only
single
words
while
others
repeat
the
same
phrase
over
and
over
some
repeat
what
they
hear
a
condition
called
echolalia
sing
song
repetitions
in
particular
are
a
calming
joyous
activity
that
many
autistic
adults
engage
in
many
people
with
autism
have
a
strong
tonal
sense
and
can
often
understand
spoken
language
some
children
may
exhibit
only
slight
delays
in
language
or
even
seem
to
have
precocious
language
and
unusually
large
vocabularies
but
have
great
difficulty
in
sustaining
typical
conversations
the
give
and
take
of
non
autistic
conversation
is
hard
for
them
although
they
often
carry
on
a
monologue
on
a
favorite
subject
giving
no
one
else
an
opportunity
to
comment
when
given
the
chance
to
converse
with
other
autistics
they
comfortably
do
so
in
parallel
monologue
taking
turns
expressing
views
and
information
just
as
neurotypicals
people
without
autism
have
trouble
understanding
autistic
body
languages
vocal
tones
or
phraseology
people
with
autism
similarly
have
trouble
with
such
things
in
people
without
autism
in
particular
autistic
language
abilities
tend
to
be
highly
literal
people
without
autism
often
inappropriately
attribute
hidden
meaning
to
what
people
with
autism
say
or
expect
the
person
with
autism
to
sense
such
unstated
meaning
in
their
own
words
the
body
language
of
people
with
autism
can
be
difficult
for
other
people
to
understand
facial
expressions
movements
and
gestures
may
be
easily
understood
by
some
other
people
with
autism
but
do
not
match
those
used
by
other
people
also
their
tone
of
voice
has
a
much
more
subtle
inflection
in
reflecting
their
feelings
and
the
auditory
system
of
a
person
without
autism
often
cannot
sense
the
fluctuations
what
seems
to
non
autistic
people
like
a
high
pitched
sing
song
or
flat
robot
like
voice
is
common
in
autistic
children
some
autistic
children
with
relatively
good
language
skills
speak
like
little
adults
rather
than
communicating
at
their
current
age
level
which
is
one
of
the
things
that
can
lead
to
problems
since
non
autistic
people
are
often
unfamiliar
with
the
autistic
body
language
and
since
autistic
natural
language
may
not
tend
towards
speech
autistic
people
often
struggle
to
let
other
people
know
what
they
need
as
anybody
might
do
in
such
a
situation
they
may
scream
in
frustration
or
resort
to
grabbing
what
they
want
while
waiting
for
non
autistic
people
to
learn
to
communicate
with
them
people
with
autism
do
whatever
they
can
to
get
through
to
them
communication
difficulties
may
contribute
to
autistic
people
becoming
socially
anxious
or
depressed
repetitive
behaviors
although
people
with
autism
usually
appear
physically
normal
and
have
good
muscle
control
unusual
repetitive
motions
known
as
self
stimulation
or
stimming
may
set
them
apart
these
behaviors
might
be
extreme
and
highly
apparent
or
more
subtle
some
children
and
older
individuals
spend
a
lot
of
time
repeatedly
flapping
their
arms
or
wiggling
their
toes
others
suddenly
freeze
in
position
as
children
they
might
spend
hours
lining
up
their
cars
and
trains
in
a
certain
way
not
using
them
for
pretend
play
if
someone
accidentally
moves
one
of
these
toys
the
child
may
be
tremendously
upset
autistic
children
often
need
and
demand
absolute
consistency
in
their
environment
a
slight
change
in
any
routine
in
mealtimes
dressing
taking
a
bath
or
going
to
school
at
a
certain
time
and
by
the
same
route
can
be
extremely
disturbing
people
with
autism
sometimes
have
a
persistent
intense
preoccupation
for
example
the
child
might
be
obsessed
with
learning
all
about
vacuum
cleaners
train
schedules
or
lighthouses
often
they
show
great
interest
in
different
languages
numbers
symbols
or
science
topics
repetitive
behaviors
can
also
extend
into
the
spoken
word
as
well
perseveration
of
a
single
word
or
phrase
even
for
a
specific
number
of
times
can
also
become
a
part
of
the
child
s
daily
routine
effects
in
education
children
with
autism
are
affected
with
these
symptoms
every
day
these
unusual
characteristics
set
them
apart
from
the
everyday
normal
student
because
they
have
trouble
understanding
people
s
thoughts
and
feelings
they
have
trouble
understanding
what
their
teacher
may
be
telling
them
they
do
not
understand
that
facial
expressions
and
vocal
variations
hold
meanings
and
may
misinterpret
what
emotion
their
instructor
is
displaying
this
inability
to
fully
decipher
the
world
around
them
makes
education
stressful
teachers
need
to
be
aware
of
a
student
s
disorder
so
that
they
are
able
to
help
the
student
get
the
best
out
of
the
lessons
being
taught
some
students
learn
better
with
visual
aids
as
they
are
better
able
to
understand
material
presented
this
way
because
of
this
many
teachers
create
visual
schedules
for
their
autistic
students
this
allows
the
student
to
know
what
is
going
on
throughout
the
day
so
they
know
what
to
prepare
for
and
what
activity
they
will
be
doing
next
some
autistic
children
have
trouble
going
from
one
activity
to
the
next
so
this
visual
schedule
can
help
to
reduce
stress
research
has
shown
that
working
in
pairs
may
be
beneficial
to
autistic
children
autistic
students
have
problems
in
schools
not
only
with
language
and
communication
but
with
socialization
as
well
they
feel
self
conscious
about
themselves
and
many
feel
that
they
will
always
be
outcasts
by
allowing
them
to
work
with
peers
they
can
make
friends
which
in
turn
can
help
them
cope
with
the
problems
that
arise
by
doing
so
they
can
become
more
integrated
into
the
mainstream
environment
of
the
classroom
a
teacher
s
aide
can
also
be
useful
to
the
student
the
aide
is
able
to
give
more
elaborate
directions
that
the
teacher
may
not
have
time
to
explain
to
the
autistic
child
the
aide
can
also
facilitate
the
autistic
child
in
such
a
way
as
to
allow
them
to
stay
at
a
similar
level
to
the
rest
of
the
class
this
allows
a
partially
one
on
one
lesson
structure
so
that
the
child
is
still
able
to
stay
in
a
normal
classroom
but
be
given
the
extra
help
that
they
need
there
are
many
different
techniques
that
teachers
can
use
to
assist
their
students
a
teacher
needs
to
become
familiar
with
the
child
s
disorder
to
know
what
will
work
best
with
that
particular
child
every
child
is
going
to
be
different
and
teachers
have
to
be
able
to
adjust
with
every
one
of
them
students
with
autism
spectrum
disorders
typically
have
high
levels
of
anxiety
and
stress
particularly
in
social
environments
like
school
if
a
student
exhibits
aggressive
or
explosive
behavior
it
is
important
for
educational
teams
to
recognize
the
impact
of
stress
and
anxiety
preparing
students
for
new
situations
by
writing
social
stories
can
lower
anxiety
teaching
social

emotional
concepts
using
systematic
teaching
approaches
such
as
the

for
example
some

refuse
to
recognize
autistics

because
they
still
think
of
autism
as
a

disorder

severe
that
no

is
possible
as
a
consequence
many
high

or
three
symbolic
or
imaginative
play
while
a
diagnosis
of
asperger
s
syndrome
observes
no
clinically
significant
delay
in
these
areas
the
dsm
makes
no
mention
of
level
of
intellectual
functioning
but
the
fact
that
asperger
s
autistics
as
a
group
tend
to
perform
better
than
those
with
kanner
s
autism
has
produced
a
popular
conception
that
asperger
s
syndrome
is
synonymous
with
higher
functioning
autism
or
that
it
is
a
lesser
disorder
than
autism
there
is
also
a
popular
but
not
necessarily
true
conception
that
all
autistic
individuals
with
a
high
level
of
intellectual
functioning
have
asperger
s
autism
or
that
both
types
are
merely
geeks
with
a
medical
label
attached
also
autism
has
evolved
in
the
public
understanding
but
the
popular
identification
of
autism
with
relatively
severe
cases
as
accurately
depicted
in
rain
man
has
encouraged
relatives
of
family
members
diagnosed
in
the
autistic
spectrum
to
speak
of
their
loved
ones
as
having
asperger
s
syndrome
rather
than
autism
autism
as
a
spectrum
disorder
another
view
of
these
disorders
is
that
they
are
on
a
continuum
known
as
autistic
spectrum
disorders
a
related
continuum
is
sensory
integration
dysfunction
which
is
about
how
well
we
integrate
the
information
we
receive
from
our
senses
autism
asperger
s
syndrome
and
sensory
integration
dysfunction
are
all
closely
related
and
overlap
there
are
two
main
manifestations
of
classical
autism
regressive
autism
and
early
infantile
autism
early
infantile
autism
is
present
at
birth
while
regressive
autism
begins
before
the
age
of
three
and
often
around
one
eight
months
although
this
causes
some
controversy
over
when
the
neurological
differences
involved
in
autism
truly
begin
some
believe
that
it
is
only
a
matter
of
when
an
environmental
toxin
triggers
the
disorder
this
triggering
could
occur
during
gestation
due
to
a
toxin
that
enters
the
mother
s
body
and
is
transfered
to
the
fetus
the
triggering
could
also
occur
after
birth
during
the
crucial
early
nervous
system
development
of
the
child
due
to
a
toxin
directly
entering
the
child
s
body
increase
in
diagnoses
of
autism
the
number
of
reported
cases
of
autism
has
increased
dramatically
over
the
past
decade
statistics
in
graph
from
the
national
center
for
health
statistics
there
has
been
an
explosion
worldwide
in
reported
cases
of
autism
over
the
last
ten
years
which
is
largely
reminiscent
of
increases
in
the
diagnosis
of
schizophrenia
and
multiple
personality
disorder
in
the
twentieth
century
this
has
brought
rise
to
a
number
of
different
theories
as
to
the
nature
of
the
sudden
increase
epidemiologists
argue
that
the
rise
in
diagnoses
in
the
united
states
is
partly
or
entirely
attributable
to
changes
in
diagnostic
criteria
reclassifications
public
awareness
and
the
incentive
to
receive
federally
mandated
services
a
widely
cited
study
from
the
m
i
n
d
institute
in

claimed
that
the
increase
in
autism
is
real
even
after
those
complicating
factors
are
accounted
for
see
reference
in
this
section
below
other
researchers
remain
unconvinced
see
references
below
including
dr
chris
johnson
a
professor
of
pediatrics
at
the
university
of
texas
health
sciences
center
at
san

and

of

autism
expert
panel
who
says
there
is
a
chance
we
re
seeing
a
true
rise
but
right
now
i
don
t
think
anybody
can
answer
that
question
for
sure
newsweek
reference
below
the
answer
to
this
question
has
significant
ramifications
on
the
direction
of
research
since
a
real
increase
would
focus
more
attention
and
research
funding
on
the
search
for
environmental
factors
while
little
or
no
real
increase
would
focus
more
attention
to
genetics
on
the
other
hand
it
is
conceivable
that
certain
environmental
factors
vaccination
diet
societal
changes
may
have
a
particular
impact
on
people
with
a
specific
genetic
constitution
there
is
little
public
research
on
the
effects
of
in
vitro
fertilization
on
the
number
of
incidences
of
autism
one
of
the
more
popular
theories
is
that
there
is
a
connection
between
geekdom
and
autism
this
is
hinted
for
instance
by
a
wired
magazine
article
in
two
zero
zero
one
entitled
the
geek
syndrome
which
is
a
point
argued
by
many
in
the
autism
rights
movement
this
article
many
professionals
assert
is
just
one
example
of
the
media
s
application
of
mental
disease
labels
to
what
is
actually
variant
normal
behavior
they
argue
that
shyness
lack
of
athletic
ability
or
social
skills
and
intellectual
interests
even
when
they
seem
unusual
to
others
are
not
in
themselves
signs
of
autism
or
asperger
s
syndrome
others
assert
that
it
is
actually
the
medical
profession
which
is
applying
mental
disease
labels
to
children
who
in
the
past
would
have
simply
been
accepted
as
a
little
different
or
even
labeled
gifted
see
clinomorphism
for
further
discussion
of
this
issue
due
to
the
recent
publicity
surrounding
autism
and
autistic
spectrum
disorders
an
increasing
number
of
adults
are
choosing
to
seek
diagnoses
of
high
functioning
autism
or
asperger
s
syndrome
in
light
of
symptoms
they
currently
experience
or
experienced
during
childhood
since
the
cause
of
autism
is
thought
to
be
at
least
partly
genetic
a
proportion
of
these
adults
seek
their
own
diagnosis
specifically
as
follow
up
to
their
children
s
diagnoses
because
autism
falls
into
the
pervasive
developmental
disorder
category
strictly
speaking
symptoms
must
have
been
present
in
a
given
patient
before
age
seven
in
order
to
make
a
differential
diagnosis
therapies
sociology
due
to
the
complexity
of
autism
there
are
many
facets
of
sociology
that
need
to
be
considered
when
discussing
it
such
as
the
culture
which
has
evolved
from
autistic
persons
connecting
and
communicating
with
one
another
in
addition
there
are
several
subgroups
forming
within
the
autistic
community
sometimes
in
strong
opposition
to
one
another
community
and
politics
much
like
many
other
controversies
in
the
world
the
autistic
community
itself
has
splintered
off
into
several
groups
essentially
these
groups
are
those
who
seek
a
cure
for
autism
dubbed
pro
cure
those
who
do
not
desire
a
cure
for
autism
and
as
such
resist
it
dubbed
anti
cure
and
the
many
people
caught
in
the
middle
of
the
two
in
recent
history
with
scientists
learning
more
about
autism
and
possibly
coming
closer
to
a
cure
some
members
of
the
anti
cure
movement
sent
a
letter
to
the
united
nations
demanding
to
be
treated
as
a
minority
group
rather
than
a
group
with
a
mental
disability
or
disease
websites
such
as
autistics
org
present
the
view
of
the
anti
cure
group
there
are
numerous
resources
available
for
autistics
from
many
groups
due
to
the
fact
that
many
autistics
find
it
easier
to
communicate
online
than
in
person
many
of
these
resources
are
available
online
in
addition
sometimes
successful
autistic
adults
in
a
local
community
will
help
out
children
with
autism
much
in
the
way
a
master
would
help
out
an
apprentice
for
example
two
zero

was
declared
autism

in

this
idea
was
initiated
by
ivan
and
charika

parents
of
an
autistic

charin

was
led
by
the

trust
national
autistic
society
autism
london
and
eight
zero

organizations
in
the
united
kingdom
it
had
the
personal
backing
of
british
prime
minister
tony
blair
and
parliamentarians
of
all
parties
in
the
palace
of
westminster
culture
with
the
recent
increases
in
autism
recognition
and
new
approaches
to
educating
and
socializing
autistics
an
autistic
culture
has
begun
to
develop
similar
to
deaf
culture
autistic
culture
is
based
in
a
belief
that
autism
is
a
unique
way
of
being
and
not
a
disorder
to
be
cured
there
are
some
commonalities
which
are
specific
to
autism
in
general
as
a
culture
not
just
autistic
culture
it
is
a
common
misperception
that
people
with
autism
do
not
marry
many
do
get
married
often
they
marry
another
person
with
autism
although
this
is
not
always
the
case
many
times
autistics
are
attracted
to
other
autistics
due
to
shared
interests
or
obsessions
but
more
often
than
not
the
attraction
is
due
to
simple
compatibility
with
personality
types
the
same
as
is
true
for
non
autistics
autistics
who
communicate
have
explained
that
companionship
is
as
important
to
autistics
as
it
is
to
anyone
else
multigenerational
autistic
families
have
also
recently
become
a
bit
more
common
the
interests
of
autistic
people
and
so
called
geeks
or
nerds
can
often
overlap
as
autistic
people
can
sometimes
become
preoccupied
with
certain
subjects
much
like
the
variant
normal
behavior
geeks
experience
however
in
practice
many
autistic
people
have
difficulty
with
working
in
groups
which
impairs
them
even
in
the
most
technical
of
situations

some
autistic
adults
are
able
to
work
successfully
in
mainstream
jobs
usually
those
with
high
functioning
autism
or
asperger
s
syndrome
nevertheless
communication
and
social
problems
often
cause
difficulties
in
many
areas
of
the
autistic
s
life
other
autistics
are
capable
of
employment
in
sheltered
workshops
under
the
supervision
of
managers
trained
in
working
with
persons
with
disabilities
a
nurturing
environment
at
home
at
school
and
later
in
job
training
and
at
work
helps
autistic
people
continue
to
learn
and
to
develop
throughout
their
lives
some
argue
that
the
internet
allows
autistic
individuals
to
communicate
and
form
online
communities
in
addition
to
being
able
to
find
occupations
such
as
independent
consulting
which
does
generally
not
require
much
human
interaction
offline
in
the
united
states
the
public
schools
responsibility
for
providing
services
ends
when
the
autistic
person
is
in
their
two
zero
s
depending
on
each
state
the
family
is
then
faced
with
the
challenge
of
finding
living
arrangements
and
employment
to
match
the
particular
needs
of
their
adult
child
as
well
as
the
programs
and
facilities
that
can
provide
support
services
to
achieve
these
goals
autistic
savants
the
autistic
savant
phenomenon
is
sometimes
seen
in
autistic
people
the
term
is
used
to
describe
a
person
who
is
autistic
and
has
extreme
talent
in
a
certain
area
of
study
although
there
is
a
common
association
between
savants
and
autism
an
association
created
by
the
one
nine
eight

film
rain
man
most
autistic
people
are
not

mental

autism
and

are
just
two
of
the
five
pervasive

the

are

some
of

she

she

some
of
these

associated
with
rett

can
be
treated
physical

scientists
sponsored
by
the
national
institute
of
child
health
and
human
development
have
discovered
that
a
mutation
in
the
sequence
of
a
single
gene
causes
rett
syndrome
and
can
physically
test
for
it
with
a
eight
zero
accuracy
rate
rett
syndrome
in
the
past
was
sometimes
classified
as
an
autistic
spectrum
disorder
however
most
scientists
agree
that
rett
syndrome
is
a
separate
developmental
disorder
and
not
part
of
the
autistic
spectrum
childhood
disintegrative
disorder
childhood
disintegrative
disorder
cdd
and
sometimes
abbreviated
as
chdd
also
is
a
condition
appearing
in
three
or
four
year
old
children
who
have
developed
normally
until
age
two
over
several
months
the
child
will
deteriorate

and

functioning
from
previously
normal
behaviour
this
long
period
of
normal
development
before
regression
helps
differentiate
cdd
from
rett
syndrome
and
in
fact
it
must
be
differentiated
from
autism
in
testing
the
cause
for
cdd
is
unknown
thus
it
may
be
a
spectrum
disorder
but
current
evidence
suggests
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
central
nervous
system
pervasive

disorder
not
otherwise
specified
pervasive
developmental
disorder
not
otherwise
specified
or
pdd
nos
is
referred
to
as
a
subthreshold
condition
because
it
is
a
classification
which
is
given
to
someone
who
suffers
from
impairments
in
social
interaction
communication
and
or
stereotyped
behaviour
but
does
not
meet
the
criteria
for
one
of
the
other
four
pervasive
developmental
disorders
unlike
the
other
four
pervasive
developmental
disorders
pdd
nos
has
no

guidelines
for
diagnosis
so
the
person
may
have
a
lot
of
characteristics
of
an
autistic
person
or
few
to
none
at
all
note
that
pervasive

albedo
is
the
measure
of
reflectivity
of
a
surface
or
body
it
is
the
ratio
of
electromagnetic
radiation
em
radiation
reflected
to
the
amount
incident
upon
it
the
fraction
usually
expressed
as
a
percentage
from
zero
to
one
zero
zero
is
an
important
concept
in
climatology
and
astronomy
this
ratio
depends
on
the
frequency
of
the
radiation
considered
unqualified
it
refers
to
an
average
across
the
spectrum
of
visible
light
it
also
depends
on
the
angle
of
incidence

the
radiation

fresh

the
ocean
surface

albedo
the
average
albedo
of
earth
is
about
three
zero
whereas
the
albedo
of
the
moon
is
about
seven
in
astronomy
the
albedo
of
satellites
and
asteroids
can
be
used
to
infer
surface
composition
most
notably
ice
content
enceladus
a
moon
of
saturn
has
the
highest
known
albedo
of
any
body
in
the
solar
system
with
nine

em
radiation
reflected
human
activities
have
changed
the
albedo
via
forest
clearance
and
farming
for
example
of
various
areas
around
the
globe
however
quantification
of
this
effect
is
difficult
on
the
global
scale
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
changes
have
tended
to
increase
or
decrease
global
warming
the
classical
example
of
albedo
effect
is
the
snow
temperature
feedback
if
a
snow
covered
area
warms
and
the
snow
melts
the
albedo
decreases
more
sunlight
is
absorbed
and
the
temperature
tends
to
increase
the
converse
is
true
if
snow
forms
a
cooling
cycle
happens
the
intensity
of
the
albedo
effect
depends
on
the
size
of
the
change
in
albedo
and
the
amount
of
insolation
for
this
reason
it
can
be
potentially
very
large
in
the
tropics
some
examples
of
albedo
effects
fairbanks
alaska
according
to
the
national
climatic
data
center
s
ghcn
two
data
which
is
composed
of
three
zero
year
smoothed
climatic
means
for
thousands
of
weather
stations
across
the
world
the
college
weather
station
at
fairbanks
alaska
is
about
three
c
five
f
warmer
than
the
airport
at
fairbanks
partly
because
of
drainage
patterns
but
also
largely
because
of
the
lower
albedo
at
the
college
resulting
from
a
higher
concentration
of
pine
trees
and
therefore
less
open
snowy
ground
to
reflect
the
heat
back
into
space
neunke
and
kukla
have
shown
that
this
difference
is
especially
marked
during
the
late
winter
months
when
solar
radiation
is
greater
the
tropics
although
the
albedo
temperature
effect
is
most
famous
in
colder
regions
of
earth
because
more
snow
falls
there
it
is
actually
much
stronger
in
tropical
regions
because
in
the
tropics
there
is
consistently
more
sunlight
when
brazilian
ranchers
cut
down
dark
tropical
rainforest
trees
to
replace
them
with

in
order
to

the

temperature
of
the

appears
to
increase
by
an
average
of
about

scale
too
people

pine
forests
the
albedo
of
a
pine
forest
at
four
five
n
in
the
winter
in
which
the
trees
cover
the
land
surface
completely
is
only
about
nine
among
the
lowest
of
any
naturally
occurring
land
environment
this
is
partly
due
to
the
color
of
the
pines
and
partly
due
to
multiple
scattering
of
sunlight
within
the
trees
which
lowers
the
overall
reflected
light
level
due
to
light
penetration
the
ocean
s
albedo
is
even
lower
at
about
three
five
though
this
depends
strongly
on
the
angle
of
the
incident
radiation

can
be
as
low
as
five
or
as
high
as

with

being
about
the

edward
walker
s
study
in
the
great
plains
in
the
winter
around
four
five
n
urban
areas
urban
areas
in
particular
have
very
unnatural
values
for
albedo
because
of
the
many
human
built
structures
which
absorb
light
before
the
light
can
reach
the
surface
in
the
northern
part
of
the
world
cities
are
relatively
dark
and
walker
has
shown
that
their
average
albedo
is
about
seven
with
only
a
slight
increase
during
the
summer
in
most
tropical
countries
cities
average
around
one
two
this
is
similar
to
the
values
found
in
northern
suburban
transitional
zones
part
of
the
reason
for
this
is
the
different
natural
environment
of
cities
in
tropical
regions
e
g
there
are
more
very
dark
trees
around
another
reason
is
that
portions
of
the
tropics
are
very
poor
and
city
buildings
must
be
built
with
different
materials
warmer
regions
may
also
choose
lighter
colored
building
materials
so
the
structures
will
remain
cooler
trees
because
trees
tend
to
have
a
low
albedo
removing
forests
would
tend
to
increase
albedo
and
thereby
cool
the
planet
cloud
feedbacks
further
complicate
the
issue
in
seasonally
snow
covered
zones
winter
albedos
of
treeless
areas
are
one
zero
to
five
zero
higher
than
nearby
forested
areas
because
snow
does
not
cover
the
trees
as
readily
studies
by
the
hadley
centre
have
investigated
the
relative
generally
warming
effect
of
albedo
change
and
cooling
effect
of
carbon
sequestration
on
planting
forests
they
found
that
new
forests
in
tropical
and
midlatitude
areas
tended
to
cool
new
forests
in
high
latitudes
e
g
siberia
were
neutral
or
perhaps
warming
snow
snow
albedos
can
be
as
high
as
nine
zero
this
is
for
the
ideal
example
however
fresh
deep
snow
over
a
featureless
landscape
over
antarctica
they
average
a
little
more
than
eight
zero
if
a
marginally
snow
covered
area
warms
snow
tends
to
melt
lowering
the
albedo
and
hence
leading
to
more
snowmelt
the
ice
albedo
feedback
this
is
the
basis
for
predictions
of
enhanced
warming
in
the
polar
and
seasonally
snow
covered
regions
as
a
result
of
global
warming
clouds
clouds
are
another
source
of
albedo
that
play
into
the
global
warming
equation
different
types
of
clouds
have
different
albedo
values
theoretically
ranging
from
a
minimum
of
near
zero
to
a
maximum
in
the
high
seven
zero
s
climate
models
have
shown
that
if
the
whole
earth
were
to
be
suddenly
covered
by
white
clouds
the
surface
temperatures
would
drop
to
a
value
of
about
one
five
zero
c

this
model
though
it
is

also
predicts
that

offset

change
due

do

history
the
letter
a
probably
started
as
a
pictogram
of
an
ox
head
in
egyptian
hieroglyphs
or
the
proto
semitic
alphabet
by
one
six
zero
zero
bc
the
phoenician
alphabet
s
letter
had
a
linear
form
that
served
as
the
basis
for
all
later
forms
its
name
must
have
corresponded
closely
to
the
hebrew
aleph
the
name
is
also
similar
to
the
arabic
alif
when
the
ancient
greeks
adopted
the
alphabet
they
had
no
use
for
the
glottal
stop
that
the
letter
had
denoted
in
phoenician
and
other
semitic
languages
so
they
used
the
sign
for
the
vowel
and
changed
its
name
to
alpha
in
the
earliest
greek
inscriptions
dating
to
the
eight
th
century
bc
the
letter
rests
upon
its
side
but
in
the
greek
alphabet
of
later
times
it
generally
resembles
the
modern
capital
letter
although
many
local
varieties
can
be
distinguished
by
the
shortening
of
one
leg
or
by
the
angle

which

is
set
the
etruscans
brought
the
greek
alphabet
to
what
was
italy
and
left
the
letter
unchanged
the
romans
later
adopted
the
etruscan
alphabet
to
write
latin
and
the
resulting
letter
was
preserved
in
the
modern
latin
alphabet
used
to
write
many
languages

english

two
minuscule

the

the
destructive
wrath
that
brought
countless

upon
the

statue
of

these
lines
we
see
the
name
akhilleus
peleides
which
is
a
praenomen
and
a
patronymic
the
latter
being
formed
from
peleus
with
the
suffix
ides
producing
achilles
the
son
of
peleus
the
system
is
similar
to
the
names
used
by
scandinavians
before
modern
times
such
as
leif
erikson
achilles
name
can
be
analyzed
as
a
combination
of
akhos
grief
and
laos
a
people
tribe
nation
etc
in
other
words
achilles
is
an
embodiment
of
the
grief
of
the
people
grief
being
a
theme
raised
numerous
times
in
the
iliad
frequently
by
achilles
achilles
role
as
the
hero
of
grief
forms
an
ironic
juxtaposition
with
the
conventional
view
of
achilles
as
the
hero
of
kleos
glory
usually
glory
in
war
laos
has
been
construed
by
gregory
nagy
following
leonard
palmer
to
mean
a
corps
of
soldiers
with
this
derivation
the
name
would
have
a
double
meaning
in
the
poem
when
the
hero
is
functioning
rightly
his
men
bring
grief
to
the
enemy
but
when
wrongly
his
men
get
the
grief
the
poem
is
in
part
about
the
misdirection
of
anger
on
the
part
of
leadership
birth
achilles
was
the
son
of
the
mortal
peleus
king
of
the
myrmidons
in
phthia
southeast
thessaly
and
the
sea
nymph
thetis
zeus
and
poseidon
had
been
rivals
for
the
hand
of
thetis
until
prometheus
the
fire
bringer
prophesized
that
thetis
would
bear
a
son
greater
than
his
father
for
this
reason
the
two
gods
withdrew
their
pursuit
and
had
her
wed
to
peleus
when
achilles
was
born
according
to
the
most
common
version
of
the
myth
thetis
tried
to
make
him
immortal
by
dipping
him
in
the
river
styx
but
she
forgot
to
wet
the
heel
she
held
him
by
leaving
him
vulnerable
at
that
spot
see
achilles
tendon
in
an
earlier
and
less
popular
version
of
the
story
thetis
anointed
the
boy
in
ambrosia
and
put
him
on
top
of
a
fire
to
burn
away
the
mortal
parts
of
his
body
she
was
interrupted
by
peleus
and
abandoned
both
father
and
son
in
a
rage
homer
does
not
make
reference
to
this
invulnerability
in
the
iliad
to
the
contrary
he
mentions
achilles
being
wounded
although
not
seriously
peleus
gave
him
together
with
his
young
friend
or
lover
patroclus
to
chiron

the
greeks
left

the
trojan
war
they
accidentally
stopped
in
mysia
ruled
by
king
telephus
in
the
resulting
battle
achilles
gave
telephus
a
wound
that
would
not
heal
telephus
consulted
an
oracle
who
stated
that
he
that
wounded
shall
heal
according
to
other
reports
in
euripides
lost
play
about
telephus
he
went
to
aulis
pretending
to
be
a
beggar
and
asked
achilles
to
heal
his
wound
achilles
refused
claiming
to
have
no
medical
knowledge
alternatively
telephus
held
orestes
for
ransom
the
ransom
being
achilles
aid
in
healing
the
wound
odysseus
reasoned
that
the
spear
had
inflicted
the
wound
therefore
the
spear
must
be
able
to
heal
it
pieces
of
the
spear
were
scraped
off
onto
the
wound
and
telephus
was
healed

at

times
wavering

absolute
the
humanization
of
achilles
by

events
of

is
an

the
destruction

while
troilus
the

whom
some
say
was
fathered
by
apollo
was
watering
his
horses
at
the
lion
fountain
outside
the
walls
of
troy
achilles
saw
him
and
fell
in
love
with
his
beauty
whose
loveliness
of
form
was
described
by
ibycus
as
being
like
gold
thrice
refined
the
youth
rejected
his
advances
and
took
refuge
inside
the
temple
of

at

was
said
to
be

turns
his
head
aside
to
avoid
the
sight
of

and
of
achilles
noticing
his
pain
grimaces
the
scene
has
been
interpreted
as
an
act
of
welfare
and
comradeship
or
as
a
scene
with
sexual
overtones
ancient
greek
culture
often
held
the
two
to
be
lovers
achilles
took
two
three
towns
outside
troy
including
lyrnessos
where
he
captured
briseis
to
keep
as
a
concubine
meanwhile
agamemnon
took
a
woman
named
chryseis
and
taunted
her
father
chryses
a
priest
of
apollo
when
he
attempted
to
buy
her
back
apollo
sent
a
plague
through
the
greek
armies
and
agamemnon
was
forced
to
give
chryseis
back
to
her
father
however
he
took
briseis
away
from
achilles
as
compensation
for
his
loss
this
action
sparked
the
central
plot
of
the
iliad
achilles
becomes
enraged
and
refuses
to
fight
for
the
greeks
any
further
the
war
goes
badly
through
the
influence
of
zeus
and
the
greeks
offer
handsome
reparations
to
their
greatest
warrior
after
the
greeks
are
pushed
back
to
the
ships

are
just

agrees
to

place

the
next
day
patroclus
is
killed
and
stripped
of
the
